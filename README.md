# Genetic-Alghoritm
Base version of genethic alghoritm. As it was used as educational project it will not be developed after this point.
Mark: 3,5

Noted flaws with implementation:
- mutation should be implemented as probability not an input number
- only promising specimen should be picked for a crossover
- generating first specimen should be more random
- faster sorting alghoritm should be used

Specification:
- OX (Order Crossover) Operator
- Bubblesort for sorting population
- Random swap mutation
- Semi-random population generation
